              A Gnat alighted on one of the horns of a Bull, and remained
              sitting there for a considerable time. When it had rested
              sufficiently and was about to fly away, it said to the Bull,
              "Do you mind if I go now?" The Bull merely raised his eyes and
              remarked, without interest, "It’s all one to me; I didn’t notice
              when you came, and I shan’t know when you go away."

              We may often be of more consequence in our own eyes than
              in the eyes of our neighbours.
